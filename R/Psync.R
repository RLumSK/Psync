#' Downloading PENTAX (TM) Camera Images
#'
#' Some PENTAX (TM) cameras (e.g., K-1, K-70) allow a remote control and image download for via Wi-Fi.
#' Unfortunately, this feature appears to be so far limited to same smartphone apps. 'Psync' provides
#' a simple routine for selecting images and downloading them from a PENTAX (TM) camera; so far the
#' Wi-Fi connection has been established previously. The download is rather slow, but very convenient
#' if time does not matter and/or no proper cable is at hand.
